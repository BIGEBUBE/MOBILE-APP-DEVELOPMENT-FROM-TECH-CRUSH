let lastName = "VICTOR OLUEBUBECHUKWU";
let age = 18;
console.log("My name is " + firstName + lastName + ", and I am " + age + " years old.");
//2. Create two variables num1 and num2 with values 15 and 8. Calculate and print their sum, difference, product, and quotient. 
let num1 = 15;
let num2 = 8;
let sum = num1 + num2;
let difference = num1 - num2;
let product = num1 * num2;
let quotient = num1 / num2;
console.log("Sum: " + sum);
console.log("Difference: " + difference);
console.log("Product: " + product);
console.log("Quotient: " + quotient);
// 3. Declare a variable temperature with value 22. Write an if-else statement that prints 
let temperature = 22;
if (temperature < 20) {
    console.log("It is a cold day");}

//4. Create a variable price with value 50 and another variable discount with value 10.

let discount=10;
let finalPrice=50-10;
console.log("your final price: ", finalPrice);
//5. Declare a variable number with any value. Write code to check if the number is positive, negative, or zero, and print the result. 
let number=100;
if (number>0){
    console.log(number," is a positive number");

     console.log(number," is a negative number");
}
else{ console.log(number," this number is zero");
